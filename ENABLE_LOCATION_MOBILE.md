# 📍 How to Enable Location on Mobile

## The Issue
You're seeing "Tracking disabled" because the browser doesn't have permission to access your location.

1. On the Tourist App page
2. Scroll down to the bottom
3. Click the **"Enable Tracking"** button (orange/red button)
4. A popup will appear asking for location permission

### Step 2: Allow Location Access
When the browser asks "Allow location access?":
- Click **"Allow"** or **"Yes"**
- Do NOT click "Block" or "Deny"

### Step 3: Wait for Location
- You'll see "Getting your location..."
- After a few seconds, your real location will appear
- The button will turn green and say "Tracking On"
